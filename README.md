<h2>Instructions</h2>
<li>The purpose of the design is meant to simulate a digital jukebox. On landing, an album should be auto-selected with the song list and it’s additional details displayed below. Additional details included:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Track number</li>
  <li>Song length</li>
  <li>Mark as favorite</li>
  <li>Song Name</li>
  <li>Categorization</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit</li>
      <li>Upbeat</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<li>The user should then be able to scroll through the carousel both in the left and right directions.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The interaction on the carousel should be smooth and subtle. </li>
  </ul>
<li>When the user scrolls, the next album in the carousel should select and the corresponding song list and additional details should display below </li>
  <ul>
    <li>For this interaction we’d like to have the currently selected album’s song list collapse close, the albums carousel, and then the newly selected album’s song list expand open. </li>
  </ul>
<li>Please implement the interface as closely to the provided design as possible. Use the second page of the PDF to guide the styles and interactions you implement. Feel free to use any animations or interactions you think would enrich the user experience.</li>

<h2> BONUS II </h2>

Create a service to store a user’s favorite song and display the favorites highlighted when loading the page. You can assume the same user is logged in every time the page is loaded.
